# Intro

Using inscape, trace an airplane using [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-kPg4vYKfka).

Draw paths using the bezier tool. The Path>Division option is *amazing* for this.

Save it as an inkskape svg.
Open the simple.svg file you just created, and delete all the extra layers.

Then, flatten the paths:
`Extensions>Modify Path>Add segments`
`Extensions>Modify Path>Flatten Beziers`

Select the lowest value you can, and press enter.
You need to to this *last* and then immediately save as
inkscape.svg

Now you can export it to python.
